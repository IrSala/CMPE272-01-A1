The purpose of this repository is to showcase a microservice being run on a local machine.

Two files were provided, user_service.py and order_service.py. Each of these files implemented a microservice. With both of them a microservice architecture can be simulated where these services communicate with each other through HTTP requests. The user_service.py handles user-related operations such as user creation and user detail retreival. The order_service.py handles order-related operations such as order creatoin and order detail retreival.

Below is a simulation of the microservice architecture:

1. Run both user_service.py and order_service.py on ports 5001 and 5002 repspectively.

2. Create a user through user_service.py.
 
3. Retrieve user data through user_service.py.
   
4. Create order through order_service.py.
  
5. Retrieve order through order_service.py.
